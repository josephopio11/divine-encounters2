# The Weight of Glory

C.S. Lewis's essay, "The Weight of Glory," is a profound exploration of human desire, the nature of glory, and our ultimate destiny. It's a challenging and deeply moving piece that invites us to reconsider our understanding of heaven, happiness, and the very purpose of our existence. More than just a theological treatise, it's a call to embrace the longing within us and to recognize its divine origin.

## The Insatiable Longing

Lewis begins by acknowledging a universal human experience: a profound and often inexplicable longing. This isn't merely the desire for earthly pleasures or material possessions. It's a deeper, more persistent ache, a sense that something is missing, a yearning for something beyond our grasp. He describes it as a "joy" or "pleasure" that is almost unbearable, a fleeting glimpse of something infinitely beautiful and desirable.

> "If I find in myself a desire which no experience in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that I was made for another world."

This quote, perhaps the most famous from the essay, encapsulates Lewis's central argument. Our innate longing, he suggests, is evidence of our divine origin and our ultimate destiny. We are creatures made for heaven, and our earthly experiences, however pleasurable, can never fully satisfy the desires planted within us by God.

## The Nature of Glory

Lewis then delves into the concept of "glory," a term often misunderstood or dismissed in modern society. He argues that glory is not simply fame or recognition, but a kind of divine radiance, a reflection of God's own beauty and goodness. He suggests that we are created to participate in this glory, to be transformed into beings of light and love, reflecting the divine image.

He points out that we often feel embarrassed or ashamed of our desire for praise and approval. However, Lewis argues that this desire, when rightly understood, is not inherently sinful. It's a distorted reflection of our longing for God's approval, for the affirmation that we are loved and valued by the one who created us.

> "We are not merely imperfect creatures who must be improved: we are rebels who must lay down their arms."

This quote highlights the importance of humility and repentance. To receive God's glory, we must first acknowledge our own sinfulness and our need for redemption. We must surrender our pride and our self-reliance and turn to Christ for forgiveness and healing.

## The Implications for Our Lives

"The Weight of Glory" has profound implications for how we live our lives. If our ultimate destiny is to participate in God's glory, then our earthly pursuits should be guided by this eternal perspective. We should strive to cultivate virtues like love, compassion, and humility, which reflect the character of God. We should also be mindful of the fleeting nature of earthly pleasures and avoid becoming overly attached to material possessions.

Lewis challenges us to embrace our longing for heaven and to allow it to shape our desires and our actions. He reminds us that the Christian life is not about suppressing our desires, but about redirecting them towards their proper object: God himself.

> "The books or the music in which we thought the beauty was located will betray us if we trust to them; it was not in them, it only came through them, and what came through them was longing. These things—the beauty, the memory of our own past—are good images of what we really desire; but if they are mistaken for the thing itself they turn into dumb idols, breaking the heart. For they are not the thing itself; they are only the scent of a flower we have not found, the echo of a tune we have not heard, news from a country we have never yet visited."

This powerful analogy reminds us that earthly beauty and pleasures are merely glimpses of the ultimate reality. They are pointers to something greater, something more fulfilling. We should appreciate them, but we should never mistake them for the real thing.

## Conclusion

"The Weight of Glory" is a timeless masterpiece that continues to resonate with readers today. It offers a compelling vision of human destiny and a profound understanding of the human heart. By grappling with the concepts of longing, glory, and the nature of God, Lewis invites us to embark on a journey of self-discovery and spiritual transformation. It's a call to embrace the weight of glory and to live our lives in light of eternity.
