# The Voice Behind You

It started subtly. A whisper, really. Barely audible above the hum of the refrigerator, the clatter of dishes. I dismissed it as my imagination, the product of too much coffee and not enough sleep. But it persisted. A voice, just behind my left ear, murmuring things I couldn't quite decipher.

At first, it was just sounds. Vowels stretched thin, consonants like pebbles tumbling down a hill. Then, words began to form. Fragments of sentences, disjointed and nonsensical. "Red... always red..." it would murmur, or "The clock... it's watching..."

I tried to ignore it, to drown it out with music, with podcasts, with the relentless drone of television. But the voice was always there, a constant companion, a shadow clinging to the edge of my perception.

It grew bolder. The whispers became clearer, more insistent. The fragments coalesced into coherent, albeit unsettling, phrases. "Don't trust them," it hissed one morning as I poured my coffee. "They know."

Who knew? What did they know? I was starting to feel paranoid, constantly looking over my shoulder, scrutinizing the faces of strangers. My friends noticed the change. "You seem distracted," Sarah said over lunch. "Everything okay?"

"Fine," I lied, forcing a smile. "Just a little stressed at work."

I couldn't tell her about the voice. She'd think I was crazy. They'd _all_ think I was crazy.

The voice grew more demanding. It started telling me what to do. "Take a different route," it commanded as I headed to work. "Turn left at the next intersection."

I hesitated, then obeyed. What harm could it do? But the detour led me into a traffic jam, making me late for a crucial meeting. My boss was furious.

"Why were you late?" he demanded, his face flushed with anger.

"Traffic," I mumbled, avoiding his gaze.

"Traffic? The 405 was clear!"

The voice chuckled softly behind me. "He's lying," it whispered. "He knows about the clock."

The clock? What clock? I glanced at the clock on the wall, its hands ticking steadily. It was just a clock.

But the voice was relentless. It filled my head with doubts, with suspicions, with a growing sense of unease. I was losing control, becoming a puppet dancing to the tune of an unseen puppeteer.

One night, the voice told me to do something I couldn't ignore. "Go to the old warehouse on Elm Street," it said. "Tonight. Alone."

I refused. "I'm not doing that. What's there?"

"You'll find out," the voice replied, its tone hardening. "If you want to know the truth, you'll go."

The truth? What truth? Was this some kind of sick game? But the voice had planted a seed of curiosity, a nagging suspicion that there was something more to this than just madness.

Against my better judgment, I went. The warehouse was derelict, its windows boarded up, its paint peeling. The air hung heavy with the smell of damp and decay.

I pushed open the creaking door and stepped inside. The darkness was almost absolute, broken only by slivers of moonlight filtering through the cracks in the boards.

"Hello?" I called out, my voice trembling.

Silence.

Then, the voice spoke, louder than ever before. "Look in the mirror."

Mirror? There was no mirror.

"Behind you," it whispered.

I turned slowly, my heart pounding in my chest. And there it was. A large, ornate mirror, propped against the far wall. I hadn't seen it in the darkness.

I approached the mirror cautiously, my reflection growing clearer with each step. And then I saw it. Not my reflection, but someone else. Standing just behind me, their face superimposed over mine.

It was me. But not me. An older version, with haunted eyes and a weary smile.

"Who are you?" I whispered, my voice barely audible.

The figure in the mirror smiled. "I'm you," it said. "From the future. And I'm here to warn you."

"Warn me about what?"

"The voice," it said. "It's not coming from outside. It's coming from within. It's your own subconscious, trying to protect you from something terrible that's about to happen."

"What terrible thing?"

The figure in the mirror hesitated. "I can't tell you," it said. "It would change everything. Just trust me. Listen to the voice. It knows what to do."

And then, as quickly as it had appeared, the figure in the mirror vanished. Leaving me alone in the darkness, with only the voice for company.

"Now," the voice whispered, "it's time to run."
