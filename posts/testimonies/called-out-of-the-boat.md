# Called Out of the Boat

The story of Peter walking on water (Matthew 14:22-33) is one of the most compelling and relatable narratives in the Gospels. It's a story about faith, doubt, courage, and the unwavering power of Jesus. It’s a story that resonates deeply with anyone who has ever felt the pull of the unknown, the fear of failure, and the longing for something more.

## The Storm and the Summons

Imagine the scene: The disciples are in a boat, battling a raging storm on the Sea of Galilee. The wind is fierce, the waves are crashing, and fear grips their hearts. Suddenly, they see a figure walking towards them on the water. Terrified, they cry out in fear, believing it to be a ghost.

But Jesus reassures them, "Take courage! It is I. Don't be afraid."

Peter, ever the impetuous one, responds with a challenge: "Lord, if it's you," he says, "tell me to come to you on the water."

Jesus simply replies, "Come."

This single word, "Come," is the invitation, the summons, the call to step out of the ordinary and into the extraordinary. It's a call to trust, to believe, and to venture beyond the perceived limits of our own abilities.

## The Leap of Faith

Peter, without hesitation, climbs out of the boat and begins to walk on the water. For a moment, he experiences the impossible. He is defying the laws of nature, empowered by the word and presence of Jesus.

Think about the sheer audacity of this act. He's stepping out of the safety and security of the boat, leaving behind the familiar and known, and venturing into the unpredictable and potentially dangerous. It's a leap of faith, a radical act of trust in the power of Jesus.

## The Crushing Wave of Doubt

But then, Peter takes his eyes off Jesus. He sees the wind, he feels the waves, and he becomes overwhelmed by the reality of the storm around him. Fear creeps in, doubt takes root, and he begins to sink.

"Lord, save me!" he cries out.

Immediately, Jesus reaches out his hand and catches him. "You of little faith," he says, "why did you doubt?"

This is the heart of the story. Peter's faith faltered not because the storm was too strong, but because his focus shifted from Jesus to the storm. Doubt, like a crushing wave, overwhelmed him when he lost sight of the source of his power and strength.

## The Lesson for Us

Peter's experience is a powerful metaphor for our own lives. We are all called out of the boat in different ways. We are challenged to take risks, to pursue our dreams, to step into the unknown, and to trust in something greater than ourselves.

But like Peter, we often face storms in our lives – challenges, setbacks, and moments of doubt that threaten to overwhelm us. When we focus on these storms, when we allow fear and doubt to take hold, we begin to sink.

The key is to keep our eyes fixed on Jesus. To trust in his power, his love, and his unwavering presence in our lives. When we feel ourselves sinking, we must cry out to him, just as Peter did.

He is always there, ready to reach out his hand and pull us to safety. He may not calm the storm, but he will give us the strength to weather it.

## Conclusion

The story of Peter walking on water is a reminder that faith is not the absence of fear, but the courage to act despite it. It's about stepping out of our comfort zones, trusting in the power of Jesus, and keeping our eyes fixed on him, even when the storms of life rage around us.

So, what boat are you being called out of today? What leap of faith are you being asked to take? Remember Peter's story, and know that with Jesus by your side, you can walk on water too.
