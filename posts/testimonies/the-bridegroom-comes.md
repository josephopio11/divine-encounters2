# The Bridegroom Comes

The parable of the ten virgins in Matthew 25 is a powerful and enduring story about preparedness and spiritual readiness. It paints a vivid picture of anticipation, expectation, and the consequences of being caught unawares. Let's delve into this timeless tale and explore its profound meaning.

## The Parable: A Summary

Jesus tells the story of ten virgins who take their lamps and go out to meet the bridegroom. Five of them are wise, and they take extra oil for their lamps. The other five are foolish and only take their lamps, not anticipating the potential for a long wait.

The bridegroom is delayed. As night deepens, all ten virgins grow drowsy and fall asleep. At midnight, a cry rings out: "Here's the bridegroom! Come out to meet him!"

The virgins awaken and prepare their lamps. The foolish virgins realize their lamps are going out and ask the wise virgins for some of their oil. But the wise virgins refuse, saying there won't be enough for everyone. They advise the foolish virgins to go and buy some for themselves.

While the foolish virgins are away buying oil, the bridegroom arrives. The wise virgins, with their lamps burning brightly, go in with him to the wedding banquet, and the door is shut.

Later, the foolish virgins return, knocking and pleading, "Lord, Lord, open the door for us!" But the bridegroom replies, "Truly I tell you, I don't know you."

Jesus concludes the parable with the stark warning: "Therefore keep watch, because you do not know the day or the hour."

## Unpacking the Symbolism

Each element of the parable carries symbolic weight:

- **The Bridegroom:** Represents Jesus Christ.
- **The Virgins:** Represent believers or those who profess faith.
- **The Lamps:** Symbolize outward profession of faith or outward displays of religious practice.
- **The Oil:** Represents the inner substance of faith, a genuine relationship with God, and the Holy Spirit. It's the unseen, internal preparation.
- **The Wedding Banquet:** Represents the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life with Christ.
- **The Door:** Represents the opportunity to enter into God's presence.

## The Message: Preparedness and Authenticity

The parable's central message is a call to constant vigilance and genuine faith. It's not enough to simply _appear_ to be ready; we must cultivate a deep and authentic relationship with Christ.

Here are some key takeaways:

- **Don't rely on borrowed faith:** The wise virgins couldn't share their oil. Similarly, we can't rely on the faith of others. Each individual must cultivate their own relationship with God.
- **Procrastination has consequences:** The foolish virgins waited until the last minute to address their lack of oil. Similarly, delaying spiritual preparation can lead to missing the opportunity to enter into God's presence.
- **Outward appearance isn't enough:** The foolish virgins had lamps, but they lacked the essential oil to keep them burning. Our actions and words must be backed by a genuine and growing faith.
- **The importance of inner work:** The oil represents the unseen work of the Holy Spirit within us â€“ prayer, Bible study, repentance, and a commitment to living a life pleasing to God.

## Applying the Parable Today

In our busy and often distracted lives, it's easy to become complacent in our faith. The parable of the ten virgins serves as a powerful reminder to:

- **Examine our hearts:** Are we truly pursuing a relationship with God, or are we merely going through the motions?
- **Cultivate spiritual disciplines:** Are we consistently praying, reading the Bible, and seeking to grow in our faith?
- **Be vigilant and watchful:** Are we aware of the signs of the times and living in anticipation of Christ's return?

The Bridegroom _will_ come. The question is, will we be ready? Let us strive to be like the wise virgins, filled with the oil of the Holy Spirit, ready to welcome the Bridegroom with joy and anticipation. Let us keep our lamps burning brightly until that glorious day.
