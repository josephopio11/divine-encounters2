# The Blood on the Doorframe

It started subtly. A faint, almost imperceptible discoloration on the white paint of the doorframe leading to the attic. I dismissed it as dust, or perhaps a trick of the light. Our old house was full of quirks, whispers in the pipes, shadows that danced in the periphery. I was used to it.

But the next day, it was darker. A rusty stain, resembling dried blood. I scrubbed at it with a damp cloth, a knot of unease tightening in my stomach. It wouldn't budge. The stain remained, a silent accusation etched into the wood.

"Probably just rust from a nail," my wife, Sarah, said, her voice laced with a forced cheerfulness. She hated the attic. Hated the way the house seemed to breathe around it, a heavy, suffocating presence.

I wanted to believe her. I really did. But the stain... it felt different. It felt _wrong_.

Each day, the stain grew, spreading like a malignant vine across the doorframe. It deepened in color, becoming a viscous, crimson smear. The air around it grew cold, a chilling draft that seemed to emanate from the attic itself.

I tried everything. Bleach, paint thinner, even a power sander. Nothing worked. The blood remained, mocking my efforts.

Sarah started having nightmares. She'd wake up screaming, her body drenched in sweat, muttering about shadows and whispers. She begged me to seal the attic door, to forget it ever existed.

But I couldn't. The blood had become an obsession. I had to know where it came from, what it meant.

One night, armed with a flashlight and a rusty crowbar, I ascended the creaking stairs to the attic. The air was thick with dust and the smell of decay. Cobwebs clung to my face like ghostly fingers.

The attic was a repository of forgotten memories: moth-eaten furniture, dusty trunks filled with yellowed photographs, and forgotten toys. But there was something else, something I couldn't quite place. A feeling of profound sorrow, of unbearable loss.

As I moved deeper into the attic, the temperature plummeted. My breath formed visible clouds in the frigid air. The flashlight beam danced nervously, revealing grotesque shapes in the shadows.

Then I saw it. In the far corner of the attic, bathed in an unnatural moonlight that streamed through a cracked window, was a rocking horse. It was old, its paint chipped and faded, its single glass eye staring blankly ahead.

And on the floor beneath the rocking horse, a pool of dried blood.

I approached cautiously, my heart pounding in my chest. As I drew closer, I noticed something glinting in the moonlight. A small, silver locket.

I picked it up, my fingers trembling. It was engraved with a single word: "Eliza."

Suddenly, the attic door slammed shut. I whirled around, my flashlight beam cutting through the darkness. But there was nothing there.

Panic seized me. I hammered on the door, screaming for Sarah. But my voice was swallowed by the oppressive silence.

Then I heard it. A faint, childlike giggle, coming from behind me.

I turned back to the rocking horse. It was rocking. Slowly, rhythmically, back and forth.

And the single glass eye was now fixed on me, filled with an ancient, malevolent intelligence.

The blood on the doorframe wasn't just a stain. It was a warning. A desperate plea from a forgotten soul, trapped in the shadows of the past. And now, I was trapped with her.

The giggling grew louder, closer. The rocking horse picked up speed. And I knew, with a chilling certainty, that Eliza had been waiting for me. Waiting to tell her story. Waiting to claim me as her own.

The last thing I saw before the darkness consumed me was the rocking horse, its single eye gleaming with triumph, and the blood on the doorframe, now fresh and vibrant, a testament to my fate.
