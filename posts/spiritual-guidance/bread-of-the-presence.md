# Bread of the Presence: A Symbol of God's Covenant

The "Bread of the Presence," also known as "Showbread" or "Bread of the Face," holds a significant place in the Old Testament, particularly within the context of the Tabernacle and later the Temple in Jerusalem. This seemingly simple offering was rich in symbolism, representing God's covenant with Israel and His ongoing provision for His people. Understanding its purpose and significance offers valuable insights into the nature of God and His relationship with humanity.

## What Was the Bread of the Presence?

The Bread of the Presence is described in detail in Leviticus 24:5-9. It consisted of twelve loaves of unleavened bread, made of fine flour, and arranged in two rows of six loaves each on a table in the Holy Place of the Tabernacle/Temple. This table, known as the Table of Showbread, stood to the north of the altar of incense.

The loaves were replaced every Sabbath, and the old loaves were eaten by the priests in a holy place. This ritual was a perpetual ordinance, a constant reminder of God's presence and provision.

## Symbolism and Significance

The Bread of the Presence was far more than just food. It was a powerful symbol with multiple layers of meaning:

- **God's Provision:** The bread represented God's provision for the physical needs of the Israelites. It was a tangible reminder that He was the source of their sustenance and well-being. The twelve loaves likely symbolized the twelve tribes of Israel, signifying that God provided for all of them equally.

- **Covenant Relationship:** The offering of the bread symbolized the covenant relationship between God and Israel. It was an act of worship and thanksgiving, acknowledging God's faithfulness to His promises. The constant presence of the bread in the Holy Place served as a continuous reminder of this covenant.

- **Communion with God:** The priests eating the old loaves represented a communion with God. They were partaking in a holy offering, sharing in the blessings of the covenant. This act symbolized a close and intimate relationship with the Divine.

- **Atonement and Sacrifice:** While not explicitly stated as a sin offering, the Bread of the Presence can be seen as a form of atonement. The offering of the bread, along with the incense that accompanied it, was a way of seeking God's favor and maintaining a right relationship with Him.

- **Representation of God's Presence:** The name "Bread of the Presence" or "Bread of the Face" suggests that the bread was a symbol of God's presence. It was placed before the "face" of God in the Holy Place, representing His constant watchfulness and care for His people.

## The Bread of the Presence in the New Testament

While the Bread of the Presence is primarily an Old Testament concept, its symbolism resonates with New Testament themes. Jesus, in John 6, refers to Himself as the "Bread of Life," drawing a parallel between the physical sustenance provided by the Bread of the Presence and the spiritual nourishment He offers to those who believe in Him.

The Lord's Supper, or Communion, can also be seen as a fulfillment of the symbolism of the Bread of the Presence. The bread and wine represent Christ's body and blood, offered as a sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins. Partaking in Communion is an act of remembrance, thanksgiving, and communion with God, echoing the themes present in the Old Testament offering.

## Conclusion

The Bread of the Presence was a vital part of the worship practices in the Tabernacle and Temple. It served as a constant reminder of God's provision, His covenant with Israel, and the possibility of communion with Him. By understanding the symbolism of this ancient offering, we can gain a deeper appreciation for the nature of God and His enduring love for His people, a love that continues to be expressed through Jesus Christ, the Bread of Life.
