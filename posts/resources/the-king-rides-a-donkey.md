# The King Rides a Donkey

King Theodore the Tolerant, ruler of the sun-kissed kingdom of Atheria, was known for two things: his exceptionally long beard and his equally exceptional humility. While other monarchs paraded on magnificent steeds, adorned in gold and jewels, Theodore preferred a more… grounded approach. He rode a donkey.

Not just any donkey, mind you. This was Bartholomew, a creature of considerable stubbornness and even more considerable appetite. Bartholomew was, to put it mildly, _unimpressed_ by royalty.

The sight of King Theodore perched atop Bartholomew, his long beard flowing in the breeze, was a common one in Atheria. It was also a source of endless amusement, and occasional exasperation, for his advisors.

"Your Majesty," Lord Bartholomew (no relation to the donkey, thankfully) would often plead, "it simply isn't _dignified_! A king should ride a warhorse, a stallion of purebred lineage! Not… _that_." He'd gesture vaguely at Bartholomew, who would promptly let out a loud, defiant bray.

Theodore would chuckle, stroking his beard. "Dignity, Lord Bartholomew, is in the heart, not the saddle. Besides," he'd add with a twinkle in his eye, "Bartholomew here keeps me humble. A valuable quality in a king, wouldn't you agree?"

One day, a neighboring kingdom, the land of Grimstone, sent an envoy to Atheria. Grimstone was known for its militaristic culture and its fearsome King Grimwald, a man whose mustache could curdle milk. The envoy, a stern-faced man named Grunt, arrived expecting to be intimidated by Atheria's power.

He was, to say the least, surprised.

He found King Theodore not on a throne of gold, but sitting on a simple wooden stool in his garden, tending to his roses. And when Theodore announced he would personally escort Grunt to the border, Grunt expected a grand procession. Instead, he was greeted by the sight of the King, struggling to mount Bartholomew, who was currently attempting to eat a particularly thorny bush.

Grunt's jaw dropped. "Is… is that your royal steed?" he stammered.

Theodore, finally managing to hoist himself onto Bartholomew's back, smiled. "Indeed! Bartholomew is a loyal, if somewhat… independent, companion."

The journey to the border was a comedy of errors. Bartholomew stopped frequently to graze, ignored Theodore's gentle commands, and even attempted to rub against a particularly prickly cactus. Grunt, initially bewildered, slowly began to crack a smile. He'd never seen anything so absurd.

By the time they reached the border, Grunt was practically doubled over with laughter. He shook Theodore's hand, a genuine smile on his face. "King Theodore," he said, "I came here expecting to be intimidated. Instead, I've had the most enjoyable journey of my life. Your… unconventional approach… is truly refreshing."

Grunt returned to Grimstone and told King Grimwald of his experience. Grimwald, initially furious, eventually found himself chuckling at the tale. He realized that Atheria's strength wasn't in its military might, but in its leader's humility and genuine kindness.

And so, war was averted, not by swords and shields, but by a king, a donkey, and a healthy dose of laughter. King Theodore continued to rule Atheria with wisdom and compassion, always reminding his people that true strength lies not in outward appearances, but in the goodness of one's heart. And Bartholomew? He continued to eat whatever he pleased, blissfully unaware of his role in saving the kingdom.
