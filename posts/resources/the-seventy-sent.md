# The Seventy Sent: Mission and Discipleship

The Gospel of Luke recounts a pivotal moment in Jesus' ministry: the sending out of the seventy (or seventy-two, depending on the manuscript tradition) disciples (Luke 10:1-24). This episode offers profound insights into the nature of discipleship, the urgency of the mission, and the power available to those who follow Christ. Unlike the more familiar commissioning of the Twelve Apostles, the sending of the seventy broadens the scope of Jesus' outreach and provides a model for evangelism that resonates even today. This article explores the key aspects of this event, examining its historical context, theological significance, and practical implications for contemporary Christians.

## The Context and Commission

### A Growing Ministry

By Luke chapter 10, Jesus' ministry is expanding rapidly. He has already called the Twelve Apostles and begun to train them. The crowds are growing, and the need for laborers in the harvest is becoming increasingly apparent. It is within this context that Jesus commissions the seventy, sending them ahead of him into every town and place he himself was about to go.

This expansion signifies a deliberate strategy. Jesus is not simply trying to reach more people; he is actively multiplying his presence through his followers. The seventy are not merely messengers; they are extensions of Jesus' own ministry.

### Instructions for the Journey

Jesus provides the seventy with specific instructions, outlining both their responsibilities and their limitations. These instructions are crucial for understanding the nature of the mission:

- **Prayer for Laborers:** Jesus emphasizes the need to pray for more laborers, highlighting the divine initiative in the harvest. The mission is not solely a human endeavor; it requires God's active involvement.
- **Go Forth Like Lambs:** The disciples are sent out "as lambs among wolves," underscoring the vulnerability and potential danger they will face. This emphasizes reliance on God's protection and power, rather than on worldly strength or resources.
- **Carry No Purse, Bag, or Sandals:** This instruction promotes simplicity and dependence on God's provision. The disciples are to trust that their needs will be met as they focus on their mission.
- **Greet No One on the Road:** This seemingly harsh command stresses the urgency of the mission. The disciples are to avoid unnecessary distractions and remain focused on their task.
- **Peace Be to This House:** The disciples are to offer peace to each household they enter. If the household is receptive, the peace will remain; if not, it will return to the disciples. This highlights the importance of discernment and the power of blessing.
- **Eat What Is Set Before You:** The disciples are to accept hospitality without being overly demanding or picky. This promotes humility and gratitude.
- **Heal the Sick and Proclaim the Kingdom:** The primary task of the disciples is to heal the sick and proclaim the good news of the Kingdom of God. This demonstrates the holistic nature of Jesus' ministry, addressing both physical and spiritual needs.

These instructions paint a picture of a mission that is both urgent and dependent on God. The disciples are to be bold, focused, and trusting, relying on God's provision and power to accomplish his purposes.

## The Return and Rejoicing

### Reporting Back

Upon their return, the seventy rejoice, reporting that even demons are subject to them in Jesus' name. This demonstrates the authority and power that Jesus has delegated to his followers. It also highlights the reality of spiritual warfare and the victory that is available through Christ.

### Greater Joy

Jesus responds to their report by cautioning them not to rejoice solely in their ability to cast out demons, but rather to rejoice that their names are written in heaven. This shifts the focus from outward accomplishments to inward assurance of salvation. True joy comes not from what we do for God, but from what God has done for us.

### Revelation to the Humble

Jesus then offers a prayer of thanksgiving, praising God for hiding these things from the wise and understanding and revealing them to little children. This underscores the importance of humility and the accessibility of God's truth to those who are open to receiving it.

## Implications for Today

### A Model for Evangelism

The sending of the seventy provides a valuable model for evangelism in the modern world. It emphasizes the importance of:

- **Prayer:** Seeking God's guidance and provision.
- **Simplicity:** Focusing on the essential message of the Gospel.
- **Dependence:** Trusting in God's power rather than our own.
- **Discernment:** Being sensitive to the leading of the Holy Spirit.
- **Holistic Ministry:** Addressing both physical and spiritual needs.
- **Humility:** Recognizing that our ultimate joy comes from our relationship with God.

### Discipleship and Mission

The story of the seventy underscores the inseparable link between discipleship and mission. True discipleship involves not only learning from Jesus but also actively participating in his mission. We are called to be extensions of his ministry, bringing healing, hope, and the good news of the Kingdom to the world around us.

### Empowered by the Spirit

Just as the seventy were empowered by the Holy Spirit to perform miracles and proclaim the Gospel, so too are we empowered today. We can approach the mission with confidence, knowing that God is with us, working through us, and enabling us to accomplish his purposes.

The story of the seventy sent is not just a historical account; it is a living invitation to participate in the ongoing mission of God. It challenges us to embrace a life of discipleship, to trust in God's power, and to go forth with boldness, proclaiming the good news of the Kingdom to all who will hear.
